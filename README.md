# StoryTunes

## 1.Project Background:
I decided to plan this project with the aim of dynamically providing background music that suits each chapter by connecting the emotions in the text with the emotions in the music.

I have always enjoyed reading and listening to music, but when doing both simultaneously, my concentration tends to lean toward one side. I often wondered if it was impossible to satisfy both senses with high concentration. However, I cannot imagine movies or dramas without background music. Hence, I thought that there must be a category where these two senses can harmonize appropriately.

> **Less Directly Perceived Emotions in Texts**

Humans primarily perceive emotions through visual elements such as facial expressions or colors. Similarly, the rhythm, melody, and composition of music convey rich emotions to the listener. However, the emotions or atmosphere expressed in writing require the reader's imagination. Readers create their own imagination based on the given information, making it less intuitive than what is seen in music or movies. Moreover, since emotions in writing are conveyed through language, it is challenging to fully express emotions using a language that has limitations in depicting abstract concepts.

Therefore, this project aims to provide assistance to readers who want to immerse themselves more deeply in the emotions while reading by connecting the emotions in the text with music. It will enhance the reading experience by linking the emotional nuances of the text with suitable background music
